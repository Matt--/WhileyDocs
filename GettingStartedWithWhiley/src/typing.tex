\section{Typing}
Look at some of the interesting types in Whiley's armoury

\subsection{Unions}

\subsection{Recursive Types}

%\subsection{Polymorphism \& Encapsulation}
%Two important hallmarks of the object-oriented paradigm are
%polymorphism and encapsulation.  The former is typically achieved
%through inheritance and/or interfaces, whilst the latter typically
%exploits \lstinline{public} / \lstinline{private} modifiers.  Whiley
%does not permit \lstinline{public} or \lstinline{private} modifiers in
%records.  Instead, Whiley employs a simple form of {\em existential
%type}~\cite{}, illustrated as follows:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
% define Shape as { 
%   bool contains(int x, int y, Shape this), 
%   ... 
% }
%\end{lstlisting}
%This declares what is, essentially, an interface.  The
%``\lstinline{...}''  notation is significant here, as it denotes
%unknown --- or {\em existential} --- state~\cite{Cook09}.  We can then
%``implement'' this interface as follows:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
% define Square as {
%   int x, int y, int width, int height,   
%   bool contains(int x, int y, Square this)
% }
%
% bool defSqContains(int x, int y, Square sq):
%     if x >= sq.x && x < (sq.x + sq.width):
%         return y >= sq.y && 
%                y < (sq.y + sq.height)
%     return false
%
% Square defSquare(int x, int y, int w, int h):
%     return {x: x, y: y, width: w, height: h,
%             contains: &defSqContains}
%\end{lstlisting}
%{\bf THIS NEEDS WORK --- IT'S BROKEN}

\subsection{Structural Types}
Statically typed languages, such as Java, employ nominal typing for
recursive data types.  This results in rigid hierarchies which are
often difficult to extend~\cite{MA08}.  In contrast, Whiley employs
{\em structural subtyping} of records~\cite{Card88} to give greater
flexibility.

Suppose we wish to extend our expressions from Figure~\ref{eg1} with
assignment statements.  A common issue arises as the left-hand side of
an assignment is a restricted form of expression, often called an {\em
  lval}.  In a language like Java, we can capture this nicely using
interfaces:
\begin{lstlisting}
 interface Expr { ... }
 interface LVal { ... }
 class ListAccess implements Expr,LVal { ...}
 class Var implements Expr,LVal { ... }
 class Int implements Expr { ... }
\end{lstlisting}
However, suppose the code for expressions was part of an existing
library, and we are trying to add statements after the fact.  In a
language like Java, this presents a problem as we cannot
retroactively insert the necessary \lstinline{LVal} interface to
\lstinline{Var} and \lstinline{ListAccess}.

In Whiley, adding the notion of an \lstinline{LVal} is easy to do
retroactively because of structural subtyping:

\begin{lstlisting}
 define LVal as Var | ListAccess 
 define Assign as {LVal lhs, Expr rhs}
 
 Expr parseExpression():
     ...

 null|Assign parseAssign():
     le = parseExpression()
     match(":=")
     re = parseExpression()
     if le is LVal:
         return {lhs: le, rhs: re}
     else:
         return null // syntax error
\end{lstlisting}
Here, \lstinline{LVal} is implicitly a subtype of \lstinline{Expr} ---
i.e. there is no need for an explicit declaration of this, as would be
required in Java.  That is, they can be defined entirely separately
from each other (e.g. in different files, packages or entirely
separate programs) --- and yet, \lstinline{LVal} remains a subtype of
\lstinline{Expr}.

\subsection{Structural Subtyping.}
Whiley permits subtyping between recursive structural types.
\begin{lstlisting}
 define Link as {int data, LinkedList next}
 define LinkedList as null | Link
 define OrderedList as null | {
   int data, int order, OrderedList next
 }

 int sum(LinkedList l):
     if l is null:
         return 0
     else:
         return l.data + sum(l.next)
\end{lstlisting}
Here, we have defined a standard linked list and a specialised
``ordered'' list where \lstinline{order < next.order} for each node
(see e.g.~\cite{DS87}).  Whiley type checks this function by showing
that \lstinline{OrderedList} is a structural subtype of
\lstinline{LinkedList} --- despite this relationship not being
identified explicitly in the program.  Type checking in the presence
of recursive structural types is a well-known and challenging
problem~\cite{GLP02,CA93,KPS93} which is further compounded in Whiley
by the presence of flow-sensitive reasoning.

\subsection{Flow Typing}
We now examine Whiley's flow-sensitive type system in more detail, and
 identify several ways in which it leads to improved code quality.

\paragraph{Error Handling.}
Nullable references have proved a significant source of error in
e.g. Java~\cite{Hoa09}.  The issue is that, in such
languages, one can treat {\em nullable} references as though they are
{\em non-null} references~\cite{Pier02}.  Many solutions have been
proposed which distinguish these two forms using static type
systems (e.g.~\cite{PQVHV01,FL03,KH07,CFJJ06,CJ07,MPPD08,Hub08,HJP08}).

Whiley's flow-sensitive type system lends itself naturally to handling
this problem because it supports {\em union types}
(e.g.~\cite{BC91,IN07}).  These allow variables to hold values from
different types, rather than just one type.  For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
 null|int indexOf(string str, char c):
    ...

 [string] split(string str, char c):
    idx = indexOf(str,c)
    // idx has type null$|$int
    if idx is int:
        // idx now has type int
        below = str[0..idx]
        above = str[idx..]
        return [below,above]
    else:
        // idx now has type null
        return [str] // no occurrence
\end{lstlisting}
Here, \lstinline{indexOf()} returns the first index of a character in
the string, or \lstinline{null} if there is none.  The type
\lstinline{null|int} is a union type, meaning it is either an
\lstinline{int} or \lstinline{null}.

In the above example, Whiley's flow-sensitive type system seamlessly
ensures that \lstinline{null} is never dereferenced.  This is because
the type \lstinline{null|int} cannot be treated as an \lstinline{int}.
Instead, one must first check it {\em is} an \lstinline{int} using a
type test, such as ``\lstinline{idx is int}''.  Whiley automatically
retypes \lstinline{idx} to \lstinline{int} when this is known to be
true, thereby avoiding any awkward and unnecessary syntax (e.g. a cast
as required in e.g.~\cite{ANMM06,MPPD08}).
