\section{Verification}

As discussed in the introduction, an important feature of Whiley is
{\em verification}.  That is made up of two aspects: firstly, the
ability to write specifications for functions and methods in Whiley;
secondly, the ability of the compiler to check the body of a function
or method meets its specification.

Unfortunately, specifications is not always straightforward and
requires considerable attention to detail.  Nevertheless, with
practice, it can easily fit into the routine of day-to-day
development.  In this section, we'll explore the basics of
verification in Whiley and, in the following section, we'll look at
practical example.
