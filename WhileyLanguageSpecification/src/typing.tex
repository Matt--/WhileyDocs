\chapter{Flow Typing}
The Whiley programming language is {\em statically typed}, meaning that every expression has a type determined at compile time.  Furthermore, evaluating an expression is guaranteed to yield a value of its type.  Whiley's {\em type system} governs how the type of any variable or expression is determined.  Whiley's type system is unusual in that it operates in a {\em flow-sensitive} manner allowing variables to have different types at different program points.
